What is an Intranet?

An intranet is like a private internet for a specific group of people, usually within an organization. Think of it as a secure space where employees can share information, communicate, and collaborate without anyone from outside the organization being able to access it.

How are intranets used?

Private Network: Unlike the public internet, which anyone can access, an intranet is closed off to outsiders. Only people within the organization can use it.

Information Sharing: Employees can share documents, news, and updates easily. This helps everyone stay informed and connected.

Communication Tools: Many intranets have features like messaging, forums, or calendars, making it easier for teams to communicate and coordinate their work.

Resource Access: An intranet often contains useful resources like company policies, training materials, and forms, making it easier for employees to find what they need.
